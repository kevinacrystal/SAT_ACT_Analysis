    "## Conclusions and Recommendations\n",
    "Based on my exploration of the data, my key takeaway is that the largest increases in SAT participation rates are due to the exam being mandated by the state; thus my recommendation is that the College Board focus on getting states to add the SAT as a graduation requirement for high school students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oregon had 2018 participation rates below 50% for both the SAT and the SAT, and could be a good state to target for state-mandated testing."
